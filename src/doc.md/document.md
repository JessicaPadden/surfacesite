# API

# Modal
Using the modal feature form Boostrap 5 as a pop up. My original idea was to make the content inside as a spin the wheel to offer special dioscounts. Howvever this did not go as smooth as I would have hope. 
Instead I have incorporate a doughnut chart to display the SurFace's customer favourites from a research that was codnucted i 2025 for our offline customers

## Challenges & Benefits

*Challenges*

- JavaScript was the main pain for me personally. However, there is great benefits of JavaScript, for example, my countdown launch date and the interactiveness with the button

- Api is another one I have struggled to bring into my project. Thankfully, this has been resolved, and I have included a Free API based on the makeup brand Maybelline.

- I thought I had finished my project multiple times. However, there was always room for improvement e.g. accessible on all devices. Changing overall containers and layouts to showcase the relevant information and taking out the things I believed were not needed.

 

*Benefits*

- I have really enjoyed this course, but I have found it difficult at the same time.

- I have liked the HTML and CSS and the Bootstrap with Astro, I find myself enjoying more of the styling elements rather than using js, for example, I have included scales on product images and colour changes to let the user know which column (product) they are currently hovering over.  

- Astro has also made it easier with the style tags and the script tags, which can all be seen throughout my project
