## Introduction

- Welcome to my project. This is inspired by a makeup brand I created in my Creative Media course which I wanted to bring to live on a web server.

- By doing this project, I completed my greatest efforts for this project and made it accessible and as user-friendly as possible.

- [Project] https://github.com/JessicaPadden/surfacesite

 

 

## Language

- **HTML** – Hyper Text Markup Language which is the **skeleton of the code and adds the structure requirements**. There is a series of elements and
- **CSS** – Cascading style sheets which *adds styles and formats to the HTML*.
- **JavaScript**- calculate and manipulate data and add behaviour to the webpage.


## Frameworks
